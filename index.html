          <p class="subhead">
            I'm a senior at The University of Texas at Austin, where I'm double majoring in 
            Canfield Business Honors and Accounting with a minor in History. This fall, I'll be 
            heading to law school to build a career at the intersection of business and law. 
            Throughout college, I've focused on leadership, stakeholder management, mentorship, and 
            communication. I've applied these skills in various roles, from assisting with operational due 
            diligence for a $70+ billion investment firm to crafting marketing strategy for a manufacturing company.          </p>
